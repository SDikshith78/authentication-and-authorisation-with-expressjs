# Authentication-and-Authorisation-with-expressjs Bounty Challenge Step-2

When developing secure web applications, especially when implementing sensitive features like the "delete user" functionality, understanding the distinction between authentication and authorization is crucial. These concepts are fundamental pillars of application security, but they serve different purposes and must be implemented carefully to avoid severe vulnerabilities.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. Think of it as checking someone’s ID at the entrance. In a web application, authentication typically involves verifying credentials such as usernames, passwords, tokens, or biometric data. Authentication confirms who the user is.

Authorization, on the other hand, determines what actions an authenticated user is permitted to perform. It’s like verifying whether someone who has passed the ID check is authorized to enter a restricted area. In other words, authorization controls what resources or operations the user can access or manipulate based on their role or permission level.

To summarize:
* Authentication: Confirms who you are.
* Authorization: Determines what you are allowed to do.

----- Why Authentication Alone is Not Enough -----
Given the explanation above, a common misconception is that once a user is authenticated, they should be able to perform any action, such as deleting other users. However, this approach introduces significant security risks. Simply relying on authentication without robust authorization is a flawed and dangerous design.

Imagine a scenario where any authenticated user could delete other users. The consequences could range from minor disruptions to catastrophic data loss. In environments where data integrity, user management, and access control are crucial, this could lead to chaos and potential exploitation.

For instance:

A regular user, who should have limited privileges, could delete critical user accounts.
Unauthorized access to administrative functions could lead to severe security breaches, compromising the integrity of the application.
The Importance of Both Authentication and Authorization in User Deletion
A well-secured application must carefully implement both authentication and authorization. Authentication ensures that the user is legitimate, but authorization is what enforces role-based access control, restricting sensitive operations like deleting users to only those with the proper permissions, such as admins.

In technical terms, implementing a delete functionality only after authentication (without considering role-based authorization) is a bad idea. While the user’s identity might be confirmed, the lack of proper authorization checks means that users without the appropriate roles or permissions could gain access to critical operations.


-----  NOTE  ------
1. First you have to register the user account, once you created then either admin or user himself can delete the account.
2. Remember that when you try to delete the user account either as an admin or user yourself you should give exact same username along with same lower and upper       cases we enterted while registering.
